 Bank Customer Churn Analysis

 Project Overview  
This project analyzes **bank customer churn patterns** using demographic, financial, and engagement data. The goal is to uncover key churn drivers and propose actionable strategies for improving retention.  
Analysis was performed in **Python (Jupyter Notebook)** with visual insights created using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.


## Dataset  

The dataset consists of **two sheets** (merged on a common customer key):  

1. **Customer Data** â€“ Name, Customer ID, Age, Gender, Geography, Tenure, etc.  
2. **Account Data** â€“ Credit Score, Balance, Products Held, IsActiveMember, Estimated Salary, etc.  

**Target Variable:**  
- `Exited` â€” `1` if the customer left the bank (churned), `0` if retained.

**Source Files:**  
- `Bank_Churn_Messy.xlsx` â€” Raw dataset with two sheets.  
- `Bank_Churn_Data_Dictionary.csv` â€” Field descriptions.


## Key Insights  

1. **Geography Matters** â€“ Certain regions have churn rates up to **30% higher**.  
2. **Age Impact** â€“ Middle-aged customers (40â€“50) churn more frequently.  
3. **Active Membership** â€“ Inactive members are **twice as likely to churn**.  
4. **Tenure Influence** â€“ Shorter-tenure customers are more likely to exit.  
5. **Products Held** â€“ Low product ownership is linked to higher churn.


## Visual Findings  

- **Correlation Heatmap** â€“ Highlights the relationship between age, tenure, and churn.  
- **Churn by Geography** â€“ Regional churn disparities.  
- **Active Membership vs. Churn** â€“ Strong engagement-churn relationship.
